### ReadMe for run_analysis.R
===================

This script reasembles the test and training data provided by the client, then separates out the mean() and std() data for the X,Y and Z axis for summary.

It summarises this subset of data, providing the mean for each of these variables for each subject and activity.

The output is a tab delimited file called AverageSubjectActvities.txt.

As per the client request, the variable names have been tidied and user friendly activity names have been added.

Please see the CodeBook at <https://github.com/caraka/datasciencecoursera/blob/master/CodeBook.md> for more details about the operations performed.
